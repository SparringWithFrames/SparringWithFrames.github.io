Hey there! Welcome to Sparring With Frames. My name is Chris Carpenter, and I'm currently a solo developer. After graduating with a degree in Comp Sci from VCU, I entered the world of enterprise application development as a full stack developer. However, like many others, my heart just wasn't into the shoebox day to day that comes with working on CRUD applications, where intellectual creativity is often sidelined in favor of the bottom line. In August 2019, I made the decision to take my savings and embark on this journey. I hope to challenge myself and my weaknesses on a daily basis and ultimately grow as an individual.
